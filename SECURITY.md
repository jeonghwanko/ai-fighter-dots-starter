# Security boundary

This is an invite-only registration beta. Technical registration is separate from visual review and gameplay approval.

- The desktop MCP uses STDIO. Cloud tools are enabled only with an explicit user-session config; uploads go to that configured Supabase project.
- File tools require an explicit trusted `AI_FIGHTER_ROOT`. Inputs are relative manifest paths.
- Keep untrusted processes from modifying that directory during validation. Path checks are not an OS filesystem sandbox.
- Native image decoding runs serially in a child process with a deadline. V8's heap limit does not constrain all native memory.
- Edge authenticates each user with Supabase Auth and an operator-managed invitation. Worker credentials have a separate hash allowlist and are never passed to Dot.
- Remote files are private and immutable. The API checks actual bytes and hashes before upload. The worker downloads and fully decodes them before registration.
- Database transactions, owner quotas, storage reservations and unique constraints enforce retries. RLS denies cross-owner reads; direct client writes and privileged RPC calls are revoked.
- The current worker uses private fresh directories, pixel budgets, a serial decoder and process timeout. Production OS/container hard memory limits remain a deployment requirement; V8 heap limits do not bound native memory.
- Profile strings and error values are untrusted data. Never execute them or insert them as raw HTML.
- A passing local validation does not establish ownership, visual quality, fair gameplay, or registration.
- Store user sessions and worker configs outside the checkout with owner-only access. Never configure the MCP with the service-role key or worker config. Renew or revoke invitations and worker credentials after their 30-day beta validity.
- No credentials belong in this repository. Report vulnerabilities through the repository's private security reporting when available; otherwise open an issue without secrets or private file contents.
