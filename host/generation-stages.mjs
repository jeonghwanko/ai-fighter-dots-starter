// 호스팅 생성 워커의 단계 (P1, 2026-10-27): what each stage of a hosted generation job does on the generation PC. Every provider call goes
// through `og run <job> -- …` (the pinned service accounts, the codex slots, the ledger); this file only builds the commands, reads their
// results and checks them. Node built-ins only: the service user's node runs it.
//
// brief: the request (words and the creator's pictures) → a safety verdict, the profile draft and an English look brief, by codex with
//   every tool turned off (the request is data; a model that could read files could put the service's logins into the profile).
// appearance: the look brief → two candidate stills at once (sprite-gen `gen`, GPT image, side view facing right, transparent), as WebP.
//   맡기기 (a job its creator left to us): a look judge (codex, tools off) picks one, and the job goes on to the motions without him.
// motions (P2, 2026-10-28): the chosen look → six GPT keypose rows (prepare → gen-set → extract, assembled by motions.py) and a Grok walk
//   and run (video-set → the engine's cut and cycle alignment, its retake reasons and a vision judge as the gate; a retake films from a relaxed,
//   depth-shaded still of the look, and one alignment runs at a time on the GPU; a run the gate refused is made from the walk that passed,
//   played faster, and its preview says so), the three at once, every
//   frame brought to the look's size (sprite-gen scale-check, measured by the head), packed with reviewPolicy engine-loop, one preview per clip. A creator's change to one clip remakes that clip only: an action clip's rows drawn
//   again with his words (its cells alone replace the first run's), a walk or run filmed again with them; idle is the look (an operator's).
//   A seventh, optional row (2026-10-28) draws the entrance and the victory beside the six; when it fails the fighter goes without them.
//   The action clips' previews go up as the rows finish (2026-10-30): gen-set's finished rows are extracted in a scratch run while it still draws the rest.
// submitting: the package the motions stage left in the job folder, with the profile the creator confirmed, submitted under his account.
