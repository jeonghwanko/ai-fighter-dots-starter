# Dots VM acceptance record — 0.5.5 candidate

## Implemented scope

- A small Git front door resolves an immutable source commit, delegates installation/check/recovery,
  and retains the original runtime when a character already exists.
- A clean Linux saved-environment recipe installs pinned Node/Grok plus Python, ffmpeg and WebP.
  Device login occurs in each user's running VM, after publishing the environment.
- The selected product path is Grok subscription image/video. Codex protected-session collection and
  XAI_API_KEY fallback are blocked in Dots dispatch. Unobserved media capability remains unknown.
- Private PNG originals use owner-scoped storage, immutable idempotency, sealed short-lived VM grants,
  exact byte/hash verification, full PNG decoding, and local no-clobber admission.
- Startup returns one next action and recovers unknown jobs before any new work. Creation then follows
  the existing review groups; source receipt, generation, display and acceptance stay distinct.

## Evidence collected (2026-10-28 KST)

On Windows, the 13 related suites (creator-sources, dots-start, dots-workspace, portable-plugin,
cloud-mcp, plugin-bundle, migration-rules, api, file-input-probe, runtime-fetch,
cloud-plugin-publication, creator-plugin, sprite-tools) report **115 passed, 0 failed, 5 skipped**.
Skipped checks require POSIX permissions/symlinks or the Linux WebP fixture. Directory junction rejection
did run on Windows. Actual npm --version through the repaired launcher returned **10.9.7**.
The initial Linux shell recipe passed Bash syntax validation. Subsequent prepared-image evidence is recorded below.

The existing Dots VM task **ODDBOUT 0.4.0 분리 설치 검증** ran the candidate in
/workspace/oddbout-dots-vm-acceptance-20261028, preserving the original checkouts.
The task title is not the installed version: its old light kit was actually 0.3.0.
The tested front door was c6ebe4a, runtime 66aab684addabdf211b5d23cd41536aa0bfb33f2, kit 0.5.5,
engine pin **0dc264ba257c0d417f86ef797bc503f933e1e142**.

- Real VM tools: Node 24.19.0, npm 11.9.0, Python 3.12.14, ffmpeg/ffprobe 7.1.5.
  The pinned Python engine installed as 3.4.0. This is not the new image's Node 22.22.2 recipe.
- npm installation succeeded; WebP was missing and its download prevented full setup.
  Fixed in the follow-up: use inherited proxy transport, return a nonzero front-door exit on
  installation failure, and report only a sanitized known blocker/host.
- Reinvoking the entry preserved the same six monitored files, hashes and mtimes; no pull, reinstall,
  or generation dispatch occurred. A real VM restart was not performed.
- Grok 1.0.70 initially failed in its npm postinstall at the unwritable home directory.
  The same official lock with npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund succeeded;
  its unmodified launcher returned **grok 1.0.70 (f50904eaee6c)**, exit 0.
  No HOME/GROK_HOME changes, authentication copying, source patches or login occurred.
- Linux's original 12 Codex fixture failures came from running mock PC tests inside a marked Dots
  runtime. On a clean checkout, **107 passed, 1 failed** across the original 108 tests.
  The remaining POSIX cleanup-hook order was fixed. The follow-up at front-door 647483c / runtime
  97890ddf399cbbaae9351ee6d11ac0776714d7b0 ran all 13 suites: **120 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**, exit 0.
- The existing VM network policy lacks storage.googleapis.com and
  ztfxxhtmtrvxvuxlqmgz.supabase.co. The saved environment must be republished and a fresh VM
  validated; neither repository code nor relogin changes this host policy. The follow-up attempted a new
  workspace install once: npm exit 0, sprite exit 1, front-door exit 1; nextAction correctly named
  environment-preparer, repair-installation, network-connect-forbidden and storage.googleapis.com.

The private-source migration is applied and MCP **v30** deployed. Production checks confirmed a private
16 MiB PNG bucket, owner checks, service-only table/RPC access and unauthenticated HTTP 401.
The public tool list contains store_creator_source, get_creator_source and prepare_creator_source_download.
The old VM catalog remains stale; after the official app refresh, a newly created Work task exposed all
three with their input schemas. The actual native file/private VM transfer trial is recorded below.
Local security tests additionally use migrated PostgreSQL (PGlite) and simulated Storage.

## Published settings and actual VM installation

With the user's explicit approval, the saved ai-fighter-dots-starter environment was published on
2026-10-28 KST. Its initial install script pinned front door 1f110b3e37c4cfbc965014960e937d646c57b630,
which pins runtime 97890ddf399cbbaae9351ee6d11ac0776714d7b0. Start instructions cover the complete
Grok creation/recovery flow. The exact three hosts nodejs.org, storage.googleapis.com and
ztfxxhtmtrvxvuxlqmgz.supabase.co were added (8 -> 11 custom hosts). Unrestricted Internet remains off;
no proxy secrets or environment credentials were added.

The task-creation tool's default Work task (6ae0cf8e-5e78-83ec-88e7-116b2ed2066e) did not select this
saved environment. Its host e359ea652db4 correctly stopped before installation. The browser's Codex
Cloud environment selector resolved that routing issue: task **ODDBOUT 0.5.5 게시 환경 실증**
(01a17e32-c032-77ac-887c-7913888b50ac), host fffae06c15fb, started in /workspace with all three added
hosts allowed. All three private-source MCP tools are visible there.

This correctly selected VM still had old main b1e1966 and no prepared env.sh/Grok/WebP. Publication had
applied settings but did not demonstrate execution of the saved installer or capture of prepared tools.
A separate direct installation trial preserved that original checkout and all previous attempt logs:

| Front door | Actual result | Follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1f110b3 | exit 127, sudo absent before installation | Check/reuse usable base tools; apt only for missing tools with supported privilege |
| fdae405 | Node 22.22.2 SHA-256 and execution pass; exit 254 at npm home cache | Keep npm/pip download caches in the workspace; retain official authentication locations |
| 6b7b8bfaf6728dff8f75b8f155c356616ee0f592 | installer exit 0 | Actual installation and ordinary resume both exit 0 |

The final script ran once. Actual kit 0.5.5, Node 22.22.2, Python 3.12.14, Grok 1.0.70,
engine 0dc264ba257c0d417f86ef797bc503f933e1e142 and img2webp -exact were checked. The separate
/workspace/oddbout-v055-acceptance --install returned installation: reused with no installation steps;
ordinary resume retained the identical binding. Both Git traces had no pull/fetch/clone. Installation
receipt, dependency files and FETCH_HEAD hashes were unchanged. The resulting single next action was
connect-grok-subscription / sign-in-required; these checks did not log in or generate.
Evidence: /workspace/work/oddbout-v055-evidence/direct-install-6b7b8bf/verification.json and adjacent
stdout/stderr, exit-code, file-hash and Git-trace records in that VM.

At that stage, the saved environment draft named the tested front door. Preparing its reusable filesystem and
republishing still required the environment preparer. Later publication and fresh-task results follow below; an actual restart remains unverified.
Direct installation in a running user's VM does not update the reusable saved image.

## Existing character runtime and launcher verification

Runtime **52db965f7ad6f54b99e8920a6be2db14dc1e2756** installed successfully in the selected VM for
/workspace/oddbout-gun-meme-cat. Creation readiness now verifies the immutable runtime marker, workspace
binding, exact source/vendor commits and clean source instead of requiring a mutable branch or pull.
The actual kit check returned ready. The existing acceptance workspace and engine pin were preserved.

The first ordinary front-door resume failed because a child Node exited 0 with empty stdout. A bounded
read-only probe reproduced this even with console.log of a fixed test string; direct CLI execution
returned valid JSON. Path/realpath and main-guard comparisons matched, and no timeout or signal occurred.
The managed host's underlying pipe behavior remains unexplained; this was not a generation failure.

Front door **da4b05aff428a0e0bfe859a84e075237f40278ef** now imports the selected runtime's start function
and returns its typed result directly. It still verifies the bound commit before loading the runtime.
No automatic fallback, process-global environment rewrite or runtime upgrade was introduced.
In the same real VM, ordinary resume and the subsequent --install each ran once and exited **0** with
valid JSON. --install returned **installation: reused, steps: []**. HEAD, binding, install receipt and
FETCH_HEAD hashes were unchanged; Git traces contained no fetch, pull or clone. The sole next action
remained connect-grok-subscription / sign-in-required. Evidence is under
/workspace/work/oddbout-v055-evidence/frontdoor-da4b05a/.

Local readiness/startup/workspace/bundle regression tests after this change: **42 passed, 0 failed,
3 platform skips**, 45 total. CI was not run. These tests and ordinary invocation are not a VM restart.

## Prepared image publication and fresh VM (2026-10-28 KST)

The environment editor prepared front door **25ea88ff7a3084f5025f8923af8b0872cfcceafc** with
runtime **52db965f7ad6f54b99e8920a6be2db14dc1e2756**, kit 0.5.5 and unchanged engine pin.
The old image guard incorrectly treated Grok's official binary-only `.grok/bin` cache as a login.
The extracted presence-only guard now accepts that cache while rejecting unknown/hidden entries,
symlinks, ODDBOUT auth and injected API/service keys without reading their contents. Its relevant
Linux tests passed **4/4**, with no failures/skips (Windows: 3 passed, 1 POSIX skip).
Installer re-preparation exited 0 with installation: reused and steps: []; template binding, runtime
receipt and FETCH_HEAD hashes/mtimes stayed unchanged. No personal auth or character jobs were present.
Evidence: /workspace/oddbout-repreparation-evidence/summary.json in the environment editor.

The prepared filesystem was published at 08:41 KST. A separate new task explicitly selected this saved
environment: **ODDBOUT 0.5.5 준비 이미지 새 VM 검증**, thread
01a17fc0-ae3d-7039-bb4c-ffc03199a0a9, host **e13195d701ce**. Before any manual installation/fetch,
it already contained the expected front/runtime/engine commits, clean source trees, env.sh, tools,
runtime receipt and template binding. Actual versions were Node 22.22.2, Grok 1.0.70, Python 3.12.14,
ffmpeg/ffprobe 7.1.5, plus working img2webp -exact.

In /workspace/oddbout-published-image-check, first --install and ordinary resume both exited **0**
with valid JSON. Installation returned **reused, steps: []**; ordinary resume has no installation/steps
fields. Both Git traces contained no fetch/pull/clone. Across 3,575 monitored runtime items, including
receipt, FETCH_HEAD and vendor, hashes and mtimes were unchanged. Template and user binding stayed
unchanged; the presence-only guard passed before/after and inspected workspaces had no character jobs.
The sole nextAction was connect-grok-subscription. No login, generation, registration or CI ran.
Evidence: /workspace/oddbout-published-image-evidence/result.json and adjacent snapshots/traces.

This proves prepared-file propagation to a fresh VM and process reinvocation. No supported VM restart
operation was exposed; an actual reboot has not been verified. At this point the character VM's old
login process was gone and its official probe reported login: unavailable. Later login attempts are
recorded below. A subscription selection is not media entitlement.

The saved Install script was subsequently aligned to front door 25ea88f and saved as a draft.
That configuration-only republish is still pending: the environment editor reports starting/offline
and exposes no supported restart/retry action. The successful publication above proves the prepared
filesystem, not publication of that later draft.
## Auth-storage-aware candidate integration

Front e562e888153a5119a966f42cdc34382b6eacc8e2 selects runtime
0ac4032d499b7d7b4e045e46b5dfcb7ebc86f5c6 (kit 0.5.5, same engine). In the existing clean
verification VM, isolated tools/runtime/user directories completed one actual installer run,
one new-user --install and one ordinary resume, each exit 0 with valid JSON. User installation
reused dependencies with steps: []; both user invocations had no fetch/pull/clone or reinstall.
The new release-specific template retained the old template52 binding. Existing env.sh, runtime52,
template/workspace bindings and receipts kept the same hashes and mtimes.

Both user invocations correctly returned auth.storage blocked / grok-auth-storage-not-writable,
nextAction prepare-private-grok-auth-storage, dispatch false, with no login command. No login,
generation, secret setup, publish or CI occurred in this isolated test. Evidence:
/workspace/oddbout-published-image-evidence/auth-candidate-*. This confirms the new candidate installer
and resume path, not saved-image publication of the candidate. The active character keeps runtime52.

## Default creation-context proxy transport

Actual generation on Node 22 had required a process-level proxy helper for creation jobs: the store
used a default global fetch for its public game-context request. Runtime
f8eb6b5ca7ed14ce77c0a06e9ab5e513bf918346 changes that default to the existing runtimeFetch transport.
It follows the inherited proxy/CA rules, redacts transport errors and never retries with direct access.
Windows creation-context/creator-plugin/bundle tests passed 40/40. A separate clean Linux checkout
passed all 8 creation-context tests and one real default fetchCreationContext() call without a
NODE_OPTIONS helper. The validated response was contextVersion 1, revision
6e78a912c3f0500e9030ee444f82fbd98f2763997edfb69d2bb05503e0100203. Existing runtime52/runtime0ac
and binding/receipt hashes and mtimes remained unchanged. Evidence:
/workspace/oddbout-published-image-evidence/auth-candidate-context-*.

The new front-door candidate selects f8eb6b5 for new workspaces. The preceding 0ac full installer
evidence and this focused transport verification remain separate; no new saved image or character
upgrade is claimed. The environment editor currently rejects saving its changed Install script and
Start instructions without identifying a bad field. The prepared edits are retained for recovery,
and publication remains pending.

## Actual private file transfer and display boundary

A clearly labeled TEST PNG (not generated character artwork) completed official native file input,
private account-scoped Storage, sealed VM grant and receive. Original and received files were both
**3,589 bytes**, **256 x 128**, SHA-256
**60cc68255b4c2e0ff31a7c519e87ed6683d9056cac785ea05eee71099c94c4e6**.
The full PNG decoded and a repeated receive returned reused: true. Evidence is in
/workspace/oddbout-v055-acceptance/output/transfer-test/verification.json, with the corrected copy in
/workspace/work/oddbout-v055-evidence/runtime-52db965/TEST-transfer-verification.json.

VM view_image plus image emission did not establish display: the actual browser UI showed image load
failure. The host's designated /codex output mount was read-only and yielded no downloadable artifact.
Originals and receipts remain intact; that local route did not display them. No fabricated URLs, file IDs,
base64 chat dumps or duplicate generation were used. The official Pages file bridge then stored the same
TEST PNG in an owner-only personal Page. Its write_page_reference receipt returned
file_access_confirmed: true, matching byte_size and sha256. The exact native Markdown was inserted and
read back; the browser screenshot showed the complete yellow TEST / TRANSFER FIXTURE image. The parent's
read_page_reference returned actual PNG pixels, and the user explicitly confirmed seeing that image
in the parent conversation. Target-conversation still-image display is verified through this route.
Animation playback was not verified in this TEST-only trial; subsequent character evidence is recorded below. Private transfer or a source receipt alone does not prove display.

## Official Grok authentication storage

The first newly approved official device login failed after approval with
Failed to save credentials: Read-only file system (os error 30), exit 1. The default home was /home/agent
on a read-only mount; ordinary write access was unavailable. A version check had not exposed this failure.
No mount, HOME or CODEX_HOME change was attempted.

Official GROK_HOME support was verified against the xAI settings documentation and the installed CLI.
A separate, newly created empty fixture passed create/rename/read/delete of synthetic data; no credentials
were read or copied. With explicit user approval, the character VM then initialized its own
/workspace/oddbout-gun-meme-cat/.oddbout-private/grok-account directory, mode 0700, and a selector-only
account-env.sh. The exact path and mode are kit design choices, not a mandatory xAI directory layout.
The user approved the new official device code. The original process exited 0; the pinned engine
reported login: ready / billing: subscription. The auth file's metadata showed uid 1000, mode 0600
and owner-only access. No credential contents were printed. This confirms persistence in this running
VM, not persistence after an actual reboot or transfer to a different task.

The follow-up startup patch checks directory metadata and write/search access before the opt-in
credential probe or a login recommendation. A blocked/unknown directory returns
prepare-private-grok-auth-storage. The image guard also checks custom GROK_HOME and rejects a known
per-user account store. It never reads authentication contents. Relevant Windows tests:
37 passed, 0 failed, 5 platform skips (42 total). On the prepared-image verification VM, a separate
clean checkout of 52717e69f787dc497a921f212a524784f231efa3 passed all 12 auth-storage/image-cleanliness
Linux tests with no failures or skips. The actual default home returned grok-auth-storage-not-writable.
The original runtime/vendor/receipt/FETCH_HEAD and workspace/template binding hashes and mtimes stayed
unchanged. Evidence: /workspace/oddbout-published-image-evidence/auth-storage-*. This is isolated code
verification, not publication of a new saved image. The existing character remains bound to runtime 52db965.

## Actual requested appearance generation

The same character VM, runtime 52db965 and engine 0dc264b completed the requested orange meme cat
with a cartoon blaster using Grok subscription auth. The first job failed on a missing --facing
argument before provider construction; source and empty-output evidence resolved it as not-started.
The corrected job eba0be47-6d72-4cae-b262-07472fb763c6 ran once and completed succeeded / exit 0.
The report records grok-imagine-image-2.0 and one completed provider call.

The raw PNG is 832 x 1248, 666,663 bytes, SHA-256
f34df0253e2cc130eb0f24c60d917e6e4d52b9f70a9302e83a97668f6d6dcd16.
It is preserved under /workspace/oddbout-gun-meme-cat/output/gun-meme-cat-work/artifacts/idle/v1/
alongside generation-report.json and artifact-evidence.json. Automatic magenta removal failed
(only 381 nonzero-alpha pixels). A separate official white-background cutout retained the original
without another provider call. Edge cleanup is still required before game packaging.

The recovered full-body image, same-source face crop and raw original were saved to the existing
private Page page_721df1d51e808191b01432f6dd03d078 and read back. The parent retrieved actual pixels
through read_page_reference, but the user explicitly reported that these character images were not
visible in this conversation. A browser subsequently opened the actual Page full-body preview successfully and preserved a screenshot.
The user then explicitly confirmed seeing the Page preview and selected this appearance. This verifies
the Page-preview review route; the earlier read_page_reference-only inline failure remains recorded.
Locomotion was authorized next; its subsequent results are recorded below. All eleven motions and full creation acceptance remain
unverified until their own observed results.

## Actual locomotion generation and review

The same runtime 52db965 / engine 0dc264b generated real Grok subscription videos for fightIdle,
walk and run. The initial three loop checks failed and all original outputs/reports were retained.
Walk and run were recovered through the official non-generative motion-auto cutting workflow:
walk has 16 distinct frames / 960 ms; run has 12 distinct frames / 720 ms after rejecting a
shorter conversion that repeated frames. FightIdle v2 was generated once after the confirmed v1
failure and passed its numeric loop check. These are draft previews, not a validated game package.

The three GIFs were uploaded to the same owner-private Page and read back. The parent browser
opened the actual previews and captured changing walk/run poses. The user then explicitly confirmed
that the three GIFs move and chose to retain the current poses, including the two-front-paw blaster
grip while running. This confirms the Page animation delivery/review route. It does not repair the
earlier native inline display failure or certify gameplay, grounding or anatomy.

The walk near/far-foot ROI checks did not establish stride_verified. Walk/run game timing, contact
and final pixel-bound gait review remain open gates; user aesthetic selection does not override them.
Original videos, request evidence, failed loop reports and previews remain in
/workspace/oddbout-gun-meme-cat/output/gun-meme-cat-work/locomotion/.
The next attacks group was authorized after the user's locomotion selection. Defense, all eleven
validated motions, final packaging and registration are not established by this partial result.

## Actual attacks and review-only GIF repair

The same user VM completed combo v1 and slam v1 with one provider request each. Dash v1 was rejected
because the character left the video frame; that original and failure report remain intact. A separately
recorded dash v2 request with more forward canvas space passed edge/return checks. The review GIFs are
combo 33 frames / 2970 ms, slam 44 / 2640 ms and dash 26 / 2860 ms, with a common 400 px standing-height
reference. Three strikes/recoveries, one slam and one dash were observed; final game contact indices and
timing are still a packaging gate. This does not complete all eleven motions.

Actual Page review found that the first single-play combo and slam GIFs appeared briefly and then
disappeared. Every decoded frame, including the last, retained nonempty alpha. All three files had no
loop extension and disposal 2; a host end-of-animation clearing interaction is the likely explanation,
not a confirmed browser implementation diagnosis. No provider request was repeated for this issue.

The official compose-gif exporter created separate repeating review GIFs with loop-count 0 and the
original alpha threshold 128. Frame RGBA, order, dimensions and durations all match; each binary differs
only by the added 19-byte infinite-loop extension. Original single-play GIFs, game strips and once-return
metadata are unchanged. Evidence is attacks/gif-display-diagnostic.json and
attacks/review-loop-preservation.json in the character workspace. The new private Page references were
read back, and the parent browser observed all three continuing to display different poses beyond one
full cycle. The user then explicitly confirmed playback and selected the attack set. Automatic approval
review initially blocked the defense instruction. The user subsequently explicitly authorized the
defense/reaction group, and that instruction was delivered to the existing VM. Completion and user
selection of that group remain unverified.

The existing foot-evidence v2 extension was also reviewed. Initial walk ROIs touched a horizontal edge,
which the extension cannot waive. A whole-foot ROI correction removed those warnings, but both walk
feet still failed speed consistency. Walk 3-4 and run 2/8/9 include overlapping feet that limit complete
anatomical-foot identification. No v2 pass is claimed, and these results do not establish that the
artwork itself fails or justify weakening the gait gate.

Source correspondence found zero alpha pixels below the official crop in walk 8-9: touching the final
bottom boundary does not by itself prove lost sole pixels. The intermediate canonical strips select
source frames at alternating one/two-frame intervals but retain one uniform delay. Diagnostic visible
sole-edge tracks became more consistent when evaluated at the corresponding source times; they are not
certified anatomical contact points. A follow-up verified the actual selected Page GIFs against their
upload receipt hashes: both use 60 ms per frame, walk 16/960 ms and run 12/720 ms. The 41.67 ms analysis
applies only to the intermediate canonical strips. Any final package must be measured on its own pixels
and durations. Run contact/flight remains unverified because of overlapping feet and missing established
ground evidence. Reports and source comparisons are preserved under locomotion/whole-foot-followup/,
including completion-report.json. The separate official ncnn auto alignment attempts both finished:
walk exited 0 after about 31 minutes, retained 8 interpolated frames with 4 official retimings, and
improved jolt from 0.469 to 0.079 with no retake flag. Run exited 0 after about 49 minutes, rejected
9 interpolated frames and retained 2, but still reported jolt 0.568 and broken-beat / recut-or-retake.
A successful process exit did not make run a successful repair. Neither candidate is a contact/v2
pass or a user-selected replacement. Original files and selected GIFs remain intact; no provider clip
was regenerated. Actual results and comparison-report.json/.md are in locomotion/rife-repair-attempt/.

## RIFE preparation in the saved-image recipe

Front cdd0034013a99bf364c2a3e981ca394d37f9e757 keeps runtime
f8eb6b5ca7ed14ce77c0a06e9ab5e513bf918346 and prepares its official RIFE 20221029 release after the
basic bootstrap. It exports SPRITE_GEN_DATA_DIR in env.sh to a release-specific ordinary tools folder,
then requires the pinned download and actual interpolation check to succeed before preparation ends.
This closes the observed omission: basic Dots bootstrap uses --skip-rife, so successful installation did
not previously establish that video frame alignment could run in the saved VM.

The separate clean verification VM ran the full updated recipe once, exit 0. In a new shell, the
exported data path, official Python check (disc centre x=48.0), and sprite tools report all passed;
RIFE was ok with no tool warnings. New user install and ordinary resume both exited 0 with valid JSON,
reused installation steps [], and no subsequent download/fetch. Existing runtime52, tools, templates,
workspaces, bindings and receipts retained their recorded hashes/mtime. Auth presence checks passed and
recovery sessions were empty. There was no login, character generation, CI or publication. One attempted
unsupported rife check CLI invocation returned exit 2; the supported Python check passed without
repeating installation. Evidence is /workspace/oddbout-published-image-evidence/rife-preparation-*.

In the character VM, the official default backend also passed installation and its check. Absence of
familiar Vulkan driver paths was not evidence of execution failure. An earlier alternative-preparation
instruction installed torch 2.13.0+cpu, but no torch inference or backend switch occurred; the original
ncnn alignment process continued. Model/code settings and selected originals remained unchanged.
Installation/check success does not certify the candidate animation's quality or a finished fighter.
The saved-environment editor was checked again and remains starting/offline, desired running,
failureReason null. Latest recipe publication and a fresh task from that new publication remain pending.

## Related animation change

[PR #38](https://github.com/jeonghwanko/ai-fighter-dots-starter/pull/38) is in this creator-kit repository,
not crashbang-heroes. It merged into codex/creator-hosting as 43c63da3a1362aa113763a8f1f2802c639705a02.
It adds a hosted-only engine-loop packing policy: engine loop/foot-name records and visual verdicts are
bound to final frame pixels/durations, with missing/stale/failing reviews rejected. It helps Grok video
walk/run packaging but changes none of VM installation, login or private-file delivery.
Its own documentation keeps Dot creation on reviewPolicy: required. That policy is retained here;
engine-loop is not silently substituted for same-foot stance evidence. The current pinned runtime
52db965 predates PR #38. Any later runtime integration needs its pack/gait and creation-policy checks
before a new immutable pin, without upgrading a character already in progress.

## Open acceptance gates

The reviewed release remains a candidate. Prepared-image publication and fresh-task verification passed; an actual VM restart remains unverified;
official Grok login and one actual still generation passed in the existing VM. Remaining gates are
final gait/contact validation, remaining motion groups and final package. Actual locomotion videos and Page playback subsequently passed; the user reviewed and
selected the appearance through the actual Page preview. One generated appearance is not a completed fighter.

## Saved-VM acceptance checklist (remaining gates noted above)

Use the existing user's VM with an isolated validation workspace; retain existing characters and originals.
The old task title is not a version source: record actual kit manifest/version, source commit and vendor pin.

1. Read-only inventory: installed tools, proxy/network policy, active jobs and available conversation display.
2. Fresh workspace: run the Git front door at the candidate commit; record selected runtime and `nextAction`.
3. Reinvoke after restart; confirm no pull, duplicate install, provider switch or new generation request.
4. Run the relevant suites on Linux, including the three platform-dependent checks above.
5. With the connected ODDBOUT account and an existing authorized original, exercise native file input →
   private Storage → sealed VM grant → unchanged bytes + full decode. Record actual source/receipt ids.
6. Confirm an existing VM artifact is visibly delivered to the current user conversation by a supported
   host route. A path, text report or queued panel is not displayed media.
7. Confirm the user's Grok image/video access. Execute only the authorized requested appearance group;
   preserve actual provider request/output evidence and original files, show the previews, and obtain
   feedback before later groups. No throwaway generation to make a readiness report pass.
8. Continue authorized groups to eleven motions, actual gait review and validated packaging; registration
   requires the user's final registration request. Do not call an example fixture a generated fighter.

The existing VM passed the related tests and the new selected VM passed direct installation/resume,
immutable creation-readiness checks and private original transfer.
The prepared saved image passed fresh-task verification; the complete creation path remains unverified. Main must not advertise this candidate as verified until that evidence exists. Publishing/Republishing the saved environment is a host operation outside the kit.
