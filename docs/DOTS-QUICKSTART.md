# Dots: prepare once, resume the same fighter

A Git URL identifies software. It does not grant generation, registration, account access or network access.
An explicit request to make a fighter authorizes the normal preparation and requested creation steps;
do not ask again for every command. Keep the agreed review groups, provider, billing and retry boundaries.

## Choose the right environment and source

Use a per-user **saved Codex cloud environment** for this repository, with Node 22.12+, Git,
Python 3.11+ and venv, ffmpeg and ffprobe. Start from `main`, then record the exact
commit. The ordinary main checkout inspected on 2026-10-27 was kit 0.2.0; service commit
`5cddc786bc7ca4d41a06c1e2ed10a0160b081a44` was 0.5.4. A delivered 0.5.2 plugin and the preserved
0.4.0 validation runtime are separate artifacts. Read their manifests; never rename a version to imply an upgrade.
These new commands require the Dots runtime contract in this change. They do not retrofit an older kit.
The implementation is local until merged/published; the base service commit alone does not contain
these commands. Select a reviewed revision carrying them before following the commands below.

In the official saved environment setup, install common tools and locked dependencies, review the report,
then Publish. Set [DOTS-START.md](DOTS-START.md) as the Start skill/instructions. Republish updates the
prepared filesystem for **new tasks**; existing tasks keep their own files and installed tools. Continue a
fighter in its original task. Save its output separately through a supported private artifact route;
temporary files and dependency caches are not a durability guarantee.

The default Dot/Work cloud and a saved Codex coding VM have different capability and network settings.
Neither another task's `/workspace` path nor a browser/connector login grants access in this VM. Do not
assume a browser exists in the coding VM. Where supported, the user approves official device login in
their own browser outside it. A direct appearance image tool in the parent conversation is another route;
verify its actual original file handoff before the VM uses that image.

## Source checkout

For a **new** workspace only, after the host has allowed the required installation destinations:

```sh
git clone --branch main --single-branch https://github.com/jeonghwanko/oddbout-starter.git /workspace/oddbout-kit
cd /workspace/oddbout-kit
git checkout --detach <reviewed-commit-containing-the-Dots-bootstrap>
node scripts/dots-workspace.mjs doctor --workspace /workspace/my-fighter
node scripts/dots-workspace.mjs bootstrap --workspace /workspace/my-fighter --install
```

The bootstrap never fetches/merges the kit or changes its vendor pin. The existing sprite setup obtains
the gitlink's source and installs it. Source edits, a mismatched installed vendor pin, existing sessions
or incomplete recovery records block installation. Inspect them; do not reset, stash, delete locks or
start a new project to hide the problem. Preserve the commit and runtime throughout creation.

`bootstrap` without `--install` only inspects. `--install` runs `npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund`
and `node scripts/sprite-gen.mjs setup --skip-rife` when needed, using the package lock, recorded source identity and a local
install receipt. Missing dependency packages or a broken Python import trigger repair on a later explicit
install. Failures do not retry. An uncertain timeout keeps the bootstrap lock for investigation.
Python dependencies currently have upstream version ranges; this is not a fully hash-locked Python wheelhouse.

ffmpeg/ffprobe belong in the prepared environment image; bootstrap never uses sudo. img2webp must support
`-exact`; sprite setup can install the pinned binary. This bootstrap skips RIFE probes and downloads;
RIFE remains optional and is never a generation gate.
Installation success is separate from tool, auth, generation and delivery readiness.

## Verified immutable bundle

Use a reviewed release's immutable URL and **independently reviewed** helper/manifest hashes with
`fetch-creator-kit.py` as documented in [ENVIRONMENT-ONBOARDING.md](ENVIRONMENT-ONBOARDING.md).
Do not derive trust just by downloading a checksum beside an unreviewed ZIP. Record the archive hash,
release version and the bundled `runtime-manifest.json` SHA256 from the reviewed build. No `latest` alias.

For a bundle that contains this new launcher contract:

```sh
node /absolute/plugin/launcher.mjs --status
node /absolute/plugin/launcher.mjs --install --manifest-sha256 <reviewed-runtime-manifest-sha256>
```

`--status` verifies files and reports planned `runtime` and `root` paths **without writing anything**.
Only `--install` copies source. It requires the reviewed hash and retains provenance in the writable
runtime. Run the following from the **returned runtime**, using its returned absolute root:

```sh
node scripts/dots-workspace.mjs doctor --workspace <returned-root> --manifest-sha256 <reviewed-runtime-manifest-sha256>
node scripts/dots-workspace.mjs bootstrap --workspace <returned-root> --manifest-sha256 <reviewed-runtime-manifest-sha256> --install
```

A raw Git checkout is not a bundle; it has no built runtime manifest. Do not run its launcher as a
substitute for source bootstrap. Do not install a venv or node_modules in a plugin cache. Old launchers
may give `--status` different semantics: consult that artifact's own docs and do not update an active fighter.

## Doctor scopes and account boundaries

Default doctor uses local source/manifest metadata, read-only local Git commands, filesystem permission
checks and binary discovery. It does not create the workspace/cache, execute a CLI, read auth/session files,
install, log in, generate, register or use a network. Exit 0 means inspected without listed blockers;
exit 1 means action required; exit 2 means invalid input or inspection failure. Generation remains unverified.

Explicit options:

| Option | Additional scope |
| --- | --- |
| `--check-cli` | bounded version/help commands; checks img2webp `-exact` and Python version |
| `--check-auth --provider codex` | official `codex login status` only; raw output stays in memory |
| `--check-network` | public bootstrap HEAD requests only, no credentials or redirects; preserves host proxy/CA through runtimeFetch |
| `--evidence output/receipt.json` | checks a workspace-local evidence record and actual artifact bytes; never trusts `ready`, `supportsImages` or `displayed` |
| `--report output/new-report.json` | explicit new report write; never overwrites an existing report |

Doctor never certifies image access, decode, parent display or registration from login, tool names,
version strings, a marker or an agent-written receipt. Authentication may be signed-in while the image
bridge is blocked. Unknown/expired evidence remains unknown/stale. No API-key/provider/model fallback.
Grok has no official status adapter in this doctor, so it remains unknown rather than attempting a login.

The previously inspected vendor pin `38bddef764183fe2044bc85c764b0572409a6b15` reads and normally deletes
Codex rollout files. The service pin `0dc264ba257c0d417f86ef797bc503f933e1e142` was unavailable locally
during this change; its implementation remains unverified. Doctor inspects only provider source, never
session contents. Commands that actually select Codex image output are blocked **before workflow probes or dispatch**.
Explicit Grok `gen`/`gen-set`, Grok `video` and existing-request `video-resume` retain their own provider checks
without inspecting Codex source. `video-set` is Grok; only front/back walk with `--walk-start redraw` (the default)
also uses an image provider. Its explicit `--still-provider`, then `SPRITE_GEN_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`, selects that
redraw route. Side-facing vision is Grok. `--walk-start as-given` performs no redraw. Do not alter these choices
to bypass a blocker. Missing image provider selection gives a specific error rather than invoking a fallback.
CLI provider names remain `codex`/`grok`, not account labels such as GPT. `--provider=grok` is also accepted;
duplicate/abbreviated route flags are rejected. Managed Grok `gen-set` uses matching image/Grok workflow
preflight; the existing Codex sprite/`gpt-rows` preflight remains required for Codex rows.
Doctor reports only the selected provider: Grok capability remains unverified without imposing a Codex gate.
Even Codex source without the protected-session signature remains unverified
until an audited official host-file adapter exists. This change does not modify vendor code or invent that
adapter. Do not relocate CODEX_HOME, read protected sessions or enable an unrestricted sandbox to work around it.
Official `exec --json` events and `--output-last-message` are supported output mechanisms, but a final
message is not image bytes. A future adapter must bind actual tool completion to a supported original file.

`AI_FIGHTER_EXECUTION_HOST=dots`, the new bootstrap runtime marker, or a workspace environment record
with `host: dots` activates this provider-specific boundary. These are application guards, not an OS sandbox. Use the host's
security policy as well; do not bypass the wrapper by running vendor commands directly.

ODDBOUT's connected cloud tools own registration auth. Verify that account with `get_profile` and cloud
readiness; do not run local login or copy a connector session for that route. Provider device login is
separate, uses only the user's own account, and is performed only within an account-connection request.

## Network destinations: allow only the selected route

All entries below use HTTPS 443. Keep existing restrictions, proxy and CA settings. A public response,
even HTTP 403, is not proof of permission, entitlement or complete CDN coverage.

| Role | Destination | When needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Git and submodule | github.com | fresh Git installation |
| npm, optional Codex npm installation | registry.npmjs.org | uncached packages |
| Python | pypi.org, files.pythonhosted.org | uncached PyPI packages |
| immutable kit | oddbout.com | the reviewed release-download route |
| img2webp | storage.googleapis.com | pinned binary missing |
| optional RIFE | github.com, release-assets.githubusercontent.com | selected release download; verify the actual redirect host |
| other source/release assets | raw.githubusercontent.com, objects.githubusercontent.com | only if the chosen operation actually needs them |
| GPT bootstrap | auth.openai.com, chatgpt.com | selected GPT login/request route |
| Grok request | api.x.ai | preserved provider source; login and artifact hosts still need verification |
| ODDBOUT | oddbout.com, ztfxxhtmtrvxvuxlqmgz.supabase.co | homepage/context or direct VM API route |
| original image/video and Library bridge | exact officially returned/documented host | unknown until observed; no guessed CDN or wildcard |

The Package managers preset may already contain some installation hosts. Add only missing destinations
required for the selected route, publish/republish through the official environment UI, then verify in a
new task. The kit cannot perform that UI operation. Hosted apps/web search and VM commands have separate
network boundaries. Library `tools/list network` happens before materialization/file download; it is not
evidence of a particular host block. Never retry an unknown transfer or switch upload paths to bypass it.

## Storage, evidence and resume

`AI_FIGHTER_ROOT` selects the workspace; `AI_FIGHTER_CREATOR_HOME` selects writable bundled runtimes.
Default bootstrap caches are `<workspace>/.cache/oddbout/{npm,pip}`; `--cache <absolute-user-directory>`
changes that base using `npm_config_cache` and `PIP_CACHE_DIR`. HOME and CODEX_HOME are not changed.
Keep official CLI credentials in the user's private credential store, never Git, a shared template,
creation output or a dependency cache. `SPRITE_GEN_CONFIG_DIR` stores preferences, not credentials.

```sh
node scripts/dots-workspace.mjs resume --workspace /workspace/my-fighter
node scripts/dots-workspace.mjs resume --workspace /workspace/my-fighter --report output/recovery-20261027.json
```

Resume emits only session/job identifiers, revisions, verified input/output byte hashes and blockers.
It omits prompts, argv, tokens, signed URLs and raw provider output. It never dispatches or resolves jobs.
Preserve the whole project (including attempt records and raw files), not just this inventory.
Use the normal session/job tools afterward. Unknown or running jobs require original-run inspection,
never another generation because the UI stopped waiting. Lost output is not permission to regenerate.

Start a prepared job through the official host exec tool with an initial wait of **30000 ms**. If it
returns a running session/cell identifier, wait/poll that same identifier; do not start another command.
Report progress while waiting. After interruption, get the existing job and original output evidence.
No session ID or a timeout is not proof that a provider request never started. Respect explicit stop rules.

Evidence schema for doctor (all values below are placeholders, not proof):

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "environmentId": "doctor environmentId",
  "auth": {"checkedAt": "ISO timestamp", "expiresAt": "ISO timestamp"},
  "registration": {"checkedAt": "ISO timestamp"},
  "delivery": {"file": {"path": "output/original.png", "bytes": 123, "sha256": "64 hex characters"}}
}
```

Actual byte receipt, MIME/decode, Library storage, native parent attachment and parent rendering are
separate observations. Doctor verifies only the declared file bytes; decode/display stay unverified.
The delivery workflow must inspect actual media and target-conversation display before asking for feedback.
An attachment ID string, child-only preview or queued message is insufficient. See [DELIVERY.md](DELIVERY.md).
